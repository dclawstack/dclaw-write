# CRM — v1.2 Feature Roadmap

> **For coding agents:** Pick features from this list, implement them fully, and update this doc with a checkmark.
> **Do NOT change the basic stack.** See `AGENTS.md` for architecture lock.

## Pre-Flight Checklist — Do This First

Before implementing any v1.2 feature, verify:

- [ ] `frontend/package-lock.json` is committed after any `npm install` / dependency change
- [ ] `frontend/next-env.d.ts` exists and is committed (required for Next.js TypeScript builds)
- [ ] `frontend/.gitignore` excludes `node_modules/` and `.next/`
- [ ] `docker-compose.yml` healthchecks use `python urllib.request.urlopen()` (backend) and `wget -q --spider` (frontend)
- [ ] `frontend/Dockerfile` declares `ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` before `RUN npm run build`

## v1.0 Feature Inventory (Current)

- [ ] Core entity CRUD (TODO: list your entities)
- [ ] Dashboard / main page
- [ ] Real backend CRUD (no mocks)
- [ ] Docker + Helm deployment
- [ ] Alembic migrations
- [ ] Backend tests
